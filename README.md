My name is Charles. I have been coding on my own here and there since my first programming class (C programming) in college. I am currently attending a bootcamp to transition to programming full time! I love learning and understanding how and why things work the way they do. If you have any tips for me on this new journey they are greatly appreciated! If you want to reach out to me for any reason please email me at Charleslevans5@gmail.com.
